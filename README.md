# solo-pybullet
**In short**

The content of this repository was developed in the context of an academic group project. As a team of 6 ISAE-Supaero students, we worked for the LAAS-CNRS robotics lab to extend their previous repo of simulation and control for the SOLO robot.
The team was composed of Etienne ARLAUD, Ethan CHERKI, Thomas CORBERES, Thibault NOÃ‹L, Jean-Lou QUETIN and Marion VALETTE. 

This repo mainly serves the following purposes :
* providing a relevant simulation environment for SOLO (ease of use, data extraction)
* providing simulation-based controllers to easily test walking behaviors
* providing optimization tools to automatically search for viable walking behaviors
