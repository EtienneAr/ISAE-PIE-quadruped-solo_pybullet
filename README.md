# solo-pybullet
**In short**

The content of this repository was developed in the context of an academic group project. As a team of 6 ISAE-Supaero students, we worked for the LAAS-CNRS robotics lab to extend their previous repo of simulation and control for the SOLO robot.
The team was composed of Etienne ARLAUD, Ethan CHERKI, Thomas CORBERES, Thibault NOËL, Jean-Lou QUETIN and Marion VALETTE. 

This repo mainly serves the following purposes :
* providing a relevant simulation environment for SOLO (ease of use, data extraction)
* providing simulation-based controllers to easily test walking behaviors
* providing optimization tools to automatically search for viable walking behaviors

## Prerequisites
In order to properly use this package, you need to run Python3 and have the following libraries installed :
* matplotlib
* multiprocessing
* numpy
* PyBullet ( [latest version here](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) )

## Quickstart
To run a demo simulation, you can simply run the following command in a terminal :
```shell
python3 isae/scripts/run_simulation.py 
```
The `run_simulation.py` script contains hand-written parameters that are passed to a `footTrajectoryController` and a `walkSimulation` instances. The first one is customizable and basically describes the parameters of the walking behavior we want to test. The second one handles parameters like data logs, simulation duration, and also has methods for data visualization.

**TODO** : include more examples in `run_simulation`.

## Code structure
All the code can be found in the `isae` folder. Here is a quick overview of the folders it contains :
* `control` : contains the code related to the control of the robot based on predefined parameters.
* `optim` : contains the optimization code : our implementation is based on a custom genetic algorithm.
* `scripts` : contains the executable scripts that run a simulation or a whole optimization process.
* `sim_control` : contains the Bullet-related part of the code, i.e. the feedback of data to the controller and the interpretation of the commands as robot moves in the simulated environment.
* `tools` : various pieces of useful code (inverse kinematics model, video recorder).
